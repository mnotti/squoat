-markers for villain squirrels when they're off the top of the screen
--> maybe also a distance count for how far off?

-check marker's functionality for main squirrel...does it move with the squirrel off screen

-falling squirrels fall at random places in random directions

-flying squirrels fly higher(closer to top of screen/off screen)
-->can also fly super low, skimming the trampoline
